\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:sec006}

Medical imaging systems provide a promising but challenging problem for HCI research.
In this paper, we presented field research, design and comparative deployment of a multimodal user interface for breast screening,
\hyperlink{https://breastscreening.github.io/}{{\it BreastScreening}} is a proof-of-concept prototype developed to embody the emerging design goals from the underlying clinical context. 
Our work and contributions included:
a) identifying the main clinical workflow issues, the interaction cognitive load challenges~\cite{Castner:2018:ONG:3279810.3279845} and the opportunities;
b) establishing a set of design goals for medical imaging design;
c) the design, reflections and in-situ evaluation of \hyperlink{https://breastscreening.github.io/}{{\it BreastScreening}} supporting the clinical translation; and
d) the impact evidence of \textit{Multi-Modality} in diagnosing and severity classification of breast lesions with 31 radiologists in six different clinical institutions.
Our results\footnotemark[4] show that the system can lead to more efficient and accurate clinical diagnosis.
