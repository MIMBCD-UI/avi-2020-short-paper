\section{BreastScreening}
\label{sec:sec004}
To validate the proposed design goals, we created \textit{BreastScreening}, as a Medical Imaging visualization proof-of-concept to be evaluated in a realistic clinical scenario.
In our design explorations, we sought to integrate several image modalities and visualization to support insight.

\subsection{User Interface}

The User Interface (UI) consists of two main components:
\textit{4. List of Patient Views}; and
\textit{5. Medical Imaging Diagnosis Views}.
These two main components (Figure \ref{fig:both_views}) are also divided into several sections:
\textit{4.5. Study List Tabs};
\textit{5.1. Viewports};
\textit{5.2. Toolbars}; and
\textit{5.3. Modality Selection}.
Concerning \textit{5. Medical Imaging Diagnosis Views} ({\em Viewports}, {\em Toolbars} and {\em Modality Selection}) this contributes for the temporal awareness (\textit{TAS}).
More specifically, the clinician can probe for lesion patterns via the \textit{5.1. Viewports}, processing the image by using the \textit{5.2. Toolbars} features (\textit{GTO}).
The system \textit{5.2. Toolbars} are supporting our image segmentation (\textit{ISS}).
The \textit{5.1. Viewports} are displayed right after the \textit{5.2. Toolbars}, designing around and for medical images (\textit{DMI}) what also improves the temporal awareness (\textit{TAS}) of the task.
On the same time, this design is supporting the way how to interact with several modalities (\textit{SMS}).
Regarding \textit{5.3. Modality Selection}, this allows to the clinician to find more different views (\textit{SMS}) of the same lesion, allowing to perform a better severity classification (Section \ref{sec:sec005}).
Finally, the clinician may look for the lesion shape and contour irregularities (Figure \ref{fig:both_views}) to focus on the segments of the image (\textit{ISS}).
After interacting with the system at the first time, the clinician is able to efficiently process (\textit{ISS}) several images at a same time and use the various given modalities (\textit{SMS}).

\subsection{Implementation}

\textit{BreastScreening} was implemented using \textit{CornerstoneJS}~\cite{urban2017lesiontracker} with a \textit{NodeJS} server.
To populate the system, we selected image sets from HFF patients and upload them into an \textit{Orthanc} server~\cite{Jodogne2018}.
Each patient has three modalities (MG, US and MRI).

The images were pre-processed and anonymized on the \textit{Orthanc} server and then consumed by the \textit{BreastScreening} system.
The \textit{BreastScreening} core is developed in \textit{JavaScript} with \textit{jQuery} for \textit{HTML} document manipulation, event handling and \textit{dicomParser} for parsing DICOM files.
The DICOM files can be loaded by drag-and-drop files into the browser window on the \textit{Orthanc} view.
